Feedback for CS2001 Week 10 Practical


1) Report

Clear set of results. There is normally no need to screenshot the code, since you supply that as well as the report.

2) Testing

Random integer inputs, repeated after reboot to isolate JRE issues.

3) Functionality and extensions 

The set up and analysis of operations taken is good. This is how complexity should be assessed, in my opinion. We typically count flops (floating point operations) for a numeric algorithm, and work out the complexity from these. CPU timings are noisy (as you've shown) and factors like garbage collection can skew the results.

4) Code quality

Nice OO setup, with .getDuration a method of the algorithm's class.

5) Overall comments

Good empirical framework & analysis. Fitting curves to your spreadsheet values would be useful: you'd then have a formula for the asymptotic behavior in each case.

Fitting n*log(n) in excel is hard (no such option as a trendline for a scatterplot), so here is how to do it:

Arrange the data like this

A    B         C           D    E
n    merge     selection   n^2  n*log(n)
--   ------    ---------   ---  --------
10   time10    time10      100  23.0
11   time 11   time11      121  26.4
12
13
14
..

Now use the LINEST excel function.

=INDEX(LINEST(C2:Cx,D2:Dx,TRUE,TRUE),3)

=INDEX(LINEST(C2:Cx,D2:Dx,TRUE,TRUE),3)

(x denotes the maximum row number)

These return the coefficient of determination r^2 for the fit of your time data to n^2 or n*log(n) of the sorted array size.

They should both be close to 1 (i.e. 0.9998765), since selection IS quadratic and merge IS n*log(n). If they don't, you have done something wrong. Clearly, this approach generalises to more complicated complexities such as n^3*log(log(n)).
